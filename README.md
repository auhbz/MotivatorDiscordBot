# MotivatorDiscordBot
Discord bot made using the freeCodeCamp.org tutorial posted to YouTube on December 15, 2020.

The bot responds to words flagged as cries for help.
It will also pull a random quote from the zenquotes api when prompted with the `$motivate` command.

A few examples:

Users will also be able to manage their own list of motivating messages which the bot will use in conjunction with the hardcoded list.
